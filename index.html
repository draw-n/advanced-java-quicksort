          "Quicksort is an efficient, general-purpose sorting algorithm.
          Quicksort was developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in
          1959 and published in 1961. It is still a commonly used algorithm for
          sorting. Overall, it is slightly faster than merge sort and heapsort
          for randomized data, particularly on larger distributions.
        </p>

          Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a
          'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements
          into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or
          greater than the pivot. For this reason, it is sometimes called
          partition-exchange sort. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.
          This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of
          memory to perform the sorting.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any
          type for which a "less-than" relation (formally, a total order) is
          defined. Most implementations of quicksort are not stable, meaning
          that the relative order of equal sort items is not preserved.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Mathematical analysis of quicksort shows that, on average, the
          algorithm takes O(nlog(n)) comparisons to sort n items. In the worst
          case, it makes O(n<sup>2</sup>) comparisons." -
